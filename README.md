# CISC_3610_Animations

Find images and sprite sheets online to mix and match to make an animated scene on the canvas.<br/>
Convert some animated GIFs online into a sprite sheet (https://ezgif.com/gif-to-sprite)<br/>
If you like to draw, you can make your own sprite sheet from this website (https://www.codeandweb.com/free-sprite-sheet-packer)<br/>
Also available as a standalone program (https://www.codeandweb.com/sprite-sheet-maker)<br/>
Have a background.<br/>
Have talk bubbles appear for people/animals/vechicles to say things.<br/>
Make an animated scene lasting several seconds that repeats in an endless loop.<br/>
Try to tell some sort of story.<br/>
To make things easier, have functions that move the various parts in your scene.<br/><br/>

Might be useful to use JSON Array values to hold the positions/text/attributes of the items in your scene. And then go through a loop using those values to display the content.
